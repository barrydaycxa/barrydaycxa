- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @barrydaycxa
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in developing an educatonal app that sits on top of Gen AI that supports students with neurodiverse conditions, making education more of a level playing field. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently not experienced at coding at all and GitHUb doesn't make much sense to me. I'm hoping Copilot can help me!
